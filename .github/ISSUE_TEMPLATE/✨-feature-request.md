> [!NOTE]
> The core philosophy for the `vue-timeline-chart` project is to keep the functionality minimal, avoiding feature-creep. However, the component should allow customization and extending on it, without standing in your way.
> For example: instead of providing a built-in drag+drop feature, the component provides pointer events so you can implement it yourself without being limited by constraints or opinionated defaults.
> Please think about this when submitting a feature request. Thank you!
